Personal Changes made:
Made unique title screen that by clicking <space>; brings up the instructions screen which by clicking <enter>; starts the game

  Made it so that the Elephant also speeds up every 5 levels along with the apple so that the game is made possible among higher levels

  Changed various font colors on title screen and instruction screen for style
